## App
To run app, use the recommendations from React to connect to device and start app on that.

Ref.: https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device

After setting up and connecting device successfully, cd into folder `CMS`, install packages (`npm i`), then use these two commands as mentioned in the ref.:

- `npx react-native start`
- `npx react-native run-android` (currently, app is only optimized for Android, iOS is not tested yet)

## App backend
To run app backend, cd into folder `CMS-Backend`, install packages (`npm i`) then start (`npm run start`)
